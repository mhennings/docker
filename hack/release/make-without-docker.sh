# This script builds the docker binary without using docker.
#
# It is meant to be used in situations where there is no option to run docker
# before the build.
#
# This version of the build is unsupported. It is your responsibility to ensure
# all dependencies are met and that the right version of go is used.
#
# Requirements:
# - The current directory should be a checkout of the docker source code
#   (http://github.com/dotcloud/docker). Whatever version is checked out
#   will be built.
# - The VERSION file, at the root of the repository, should exist, and
#   will be used as Docker binary version and package version.
# - The hash of the git commit will also be included in the Docker binary,
#   with the suffix -dirty if the repository isn't clean.
